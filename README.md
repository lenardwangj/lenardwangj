After 6 weeks of learning Gephi, I found Gephi really interesting and quiet cutting-edge within social science realm. I am majoring computational sociology and I found most of this field of sociology are mainly focusing on social network analysis, which I am told to be the most advancing branch of sociology. The computational social science emerged from 2009 and after 5 years developing, it’s still a virgin field in social science. Basically speaking, the propose of computational social science is to put the data collected in social life into computer, aiming at analyzing the data in an not only quantitatively but also computationally way. So, Gephi is such a great software for us to visualize social relations among people and help us analyze it in a rather scientific way. And last week I attend a seminar on political information flow in EU. The paper presented was using Gephi to illustrate the information flow. And attendin this great seminar also helped me a lot to understand the utility of Gephi in empirical works. 

In my work, I managed to create a data of people’s love relationship in the American TV show Grey’s Anatomy instead of using the Facebook data. I learnt how to create a CSV. file in excel and put it into the Gephi through an online tutorial video. In this graph, nodes are the doctors, nurses and interns. And edges are the love relationship between them. Some of them like each other, so the edges are linked to both nodes; some secretly likes another one, so the edge is only linked to another. There is no bridge in this network because as bridge is defined by Granovetter(Granovetter, 1973) that the only link between two clusters(and usually a weak tie). And these nodes are all in the same hospital, so most of them know each other. If I want to create a bridge in this network, I might have to add another hospital’s network, and the relationship between chiefs of surgery in these two hospitals might become a bridge of the two clusters. Chiefs of surgery are more likely to know other hospitals’ chiefs, so they become a bridge and a structural hole (Burt, 1992). Using this structural hole, the chiefs can control the flow of information between hospitals and therefore they obtains a more important strategic position in hospitals. As Granovetter’s argument, all the bridges in networks are weak ties because the strong ties might help people in different clusters know each other, and if so it’s not a bridge any more. 

In Gephi I chose out-degree, which means the bigger node it is, the more people he/she likes or liked in the all 10 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy.
